Below is a link to our source code:
https://github.com/Sam-the-Unwise/Keras_Regularization_and_Overfitting/blob/master/regularization_and_overfitting.py

## Prerequisites
```
python
```
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip 
sudo pip3 install tensorflow 
sudo pip3 install keras
```

## Running Code instructions
In order to run this code against a dataset, download the attached files. If you wish to use your own dataset, ignore the spam.data file. To run this code against your own dataset, you will need to go into the regularization_and_overfitting.py file and change the global variable DATA_FILE to equal the string that routes to your current data set.

To run the program, simply type python3 regularization_and_overfitting.py
